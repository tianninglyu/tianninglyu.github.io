I am a fourth-year undergraduate student from [School of Physics](https://physics.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Star Formation, Interstellar Medium, Star Cluster Formation and Evolution, and Cosmology.

I am very fortunate that I'll start my graduate study at [Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Science](http://www.shao.ac.cn/) soon. During my undergraduate, I was advised by [Prof. Renyue Cen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0021210).
